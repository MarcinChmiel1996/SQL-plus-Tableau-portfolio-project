# SQL-plus-Tableau-portfolio-project
In this repository, you can find all files regarding my SQL plus Tableau project. For more details, see below.

This project contains  SQL queries (using functions like Joins, Aggregate functions, Case, Stored Procedures, IN/OUT parameters, ROUND,YEAR and other) and four Tableau visuals (combined in one dashboard).

Each visual has been created from SQL data in CSV file, which was created after executing given SQL query on Github employees database.

The project is an effect of workflow presented in Udemy course: "Become Data Analyst 2022". Although the tasks were provided by course creators, each query, CSV file and visual is an effect of my work.

Enjoy!
